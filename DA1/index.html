<h2>DR. BOB</h2>

<ul>
<li><strong>Originality:</strong>
The game features an original soundtrack and original graphics that set it apart from anything else on the Internet.
</li>

<li><strong>Technical Merit:</strong>
I started with a simple example from Phaser's examples page, but by the time I was finished none of the original example code is present in the game. To build the levels I used Tiled, a tile map editor that allowed me to export .json files that I could import into Phaser.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Postmortem:</strong>
I learned the basics of Phaser and its physics engine, along with pulling data from a tile map, getting input, and switching levels. The easiest part was learning the JavaScript (as I already knew most of it, I just needed to brush up on a few things), and the hardest was setting up my developer environment, not because it was difficult but because it was time consuming.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Assets:</strong>
100% of the assets, including the music, were created from scratch.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Closest Other Game:</strong>
My game most closely resembles Mario vs. Donkey Kong for the Game Boy Advance. I initially borrowed some code from https://www.phaser.io/examples/v3/view/physics/arcade/basic-platform but I eventually replaced all the code that I borrowed except for the game config object, making the example more of a reference.
</li>

<li><strong>High Concept:</strong>
Navigate Dr. Bob to each level's goal by carefully avoiding enemies and jumping from platform to platform. 
</li>

<li><strong>Theme:</strong>
The theme is kept rather bland and simple with the characters all resembling stick figures with simple animations, but it adds to the game's charm.
</li>

<li><strong>Mandated Variety:</strong>
The game ignores any kind of random elements and varies only with direct player input. The genre is a 2D platformer, with very light puzzle elements (if I had more time, I would have added actual puzzles).
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Goal:</strong>
The main game mechanic is just 2D movement by running and jumping. The challenges in each level are oriented around this mechanic.
</li>

<li><strong>Player Experience Goals:</strong>
I want players to be amused by the silliness and simplicity of Dr. Bob and his short and quick platforming challenges.
</li>

<li><strong>Gameplay:</strong>
A paragraph describing the actions the player can perform, the system dynamics, and the core mechanic. Include a concise explanation of the prototypeâ€™s inputs and their expected effects (how to play). You can also describe game play that is not in the prototype. You may include mock-up images for parts of the game not in the prototype.
The player uses WASD to control Dr. Bob and presses Space to jump. Each level has a starting position for Dr. Bob, the enemies, and a goal. To complete a level Dr. Bob must touch the goal and avoid the enemies; touching an enemy will start the level over. If I had more time for this project I would have implemented a spike tile which would kill Dr. Bob similar to an enemy, and I also would have given Dr. Bob a gun to shoot pellets, similar to Mega Man, and include enemies which can shoot pellets back at Dr. Bob.
</li>

<li><strong>Strategies:</strong>
Players will have to consider enemy and platform placements when moving around and trying to reach the goal. There are only a few basic gameplay mechanics (moving left and right and jumping) but in one of the game's levels careful maneuvers and planning is required.
</li>

<li><strong>Story/Setting/Premise:</strong>
After earning his PhD in Algebra, Dr. Bob puts his skills to the test in a series of platforming challenges that make up his "experiments." In designing these experiments he kept everything rather abstract, sticking to only a few colors, enemy types, and obstacles. Other than this simple backstory, there are no other narrative elements to the game.
</li>

<li><strong>Target Audience:</strong>
The demographic would be young children and senior citizens, as these groups would likely appreciate the game's simplicity.
</li>

<li><strong>Play Time:</strong>
A skilled player can complete the game in under a minute.
</li>
