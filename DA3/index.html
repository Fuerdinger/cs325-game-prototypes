<h2>Who Killed Dr. Bob? A Mystery Game</h2>

<ul>
<li><strong>Originality:</strong>
The game started with just the idea that the player could press a button to fart, and I managed to make an engaging two player game out of such a simple idea. The graphics are all original and the jazz music accompanied by cartoony fart noises all create a unique atmosphere for the game that resembles a flip-book animation.
</li>

<li><strong>Technical Merit:</strong>
There are 12 different fart sounds that are played faster or slower to match how long the player held down the fart key. The farting animations also match the player's inputs. The game has many different states it can be in, depending on whose turn it is and whether a turn just ended.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Postmortem:</strong>
I learned how to display text on the screen, get key up/key down events, and play sound effects. The easiest part was making the art as technically speaking it is a very straightforward process. The hardest part was debugging my spaghetti code.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Assets:</strong>
All art was created by me, but the sound effects and music were downloaded online. <br>

<li><strong>Prototype Closest Other Game:</strong>
My code started with the minimal template and I didn't not borrow any code from the Phaser Examples. My game is very similar to the abstract game of chicken, where two players compete to get a higher score of something, but will fail if they leave a certain threshold by getting too high of a score. Mario Party, Wii Party, and WarioWare games all have minigames which are based on this game and my game is similar.
</li>

<li><strong>High Concept:</strong>
Compete with a friend to see who can rip the loudest farts without going too overboard in the smelliest game of chicken yet!
</li>

<li><strong>Theme:</strong>
I used the "farter" storymatic theme.
</li>

<li><strong>Mandated Variety:</strong>
<br>Input: Keyboard<br>
Randomness: deterministic<br>
Play style: joker<br>
Genre: casual multiplayer
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Goal:</strong>
The game mechanic is letting a player press a key multiple times for varying lengths, and then transfer these inputs into proportional fart noises that have proportional points.
</li>

<li><strong>Player Experience Goals:</strong>
I wanted the farting to be really satisfying and continually surprising. I want players to experiment, and see what happens if you just tap a key or if you hold a key down for half a minute.
</li>

<li><strong>Gameplay:</strong>
The game is played by first hitting enter to start the game. Player 1 uses the 'F' key and Player 2 uses the 'P' key, and they alternate turns with player 1 starting first. Pressing the key and holding it will result in a fart of proportional length being "recorded" for playback once the player is finished farting. The longer the farts and the more farts there are, the more points the player will get at the end of their turn. However, if they upset the man in the middle too much, then that will cause a game over and the player will lose half of their points. Each round, farts become worth more points, but it becomes riskier to fart as the man in the middle gets angrier and angrier.
</li>

<li><strong>Strategies:</strong>
Players can try to figure out the math behind the game to create a winning sequence of farts that scores them a lot of points and puts the other player in a difficult position, where even a single short fart could cause a game over and cause them to lose half their points. Players can basically skip their turn by just lightly tapping a key, which is a technique only advanced players will likely learn of.
</li>

<li><strong>Story/Setting/Premise:</strong>
After Professor Joe and Master Ezekiel had some Taco Bell and Chipotle, they get the runs and book it to the bathroom at Walmart to rip some feisty ones. They notice that there's another guy and the bathroom, and device a smelly game of chicken. Whoever can fart the most before the stranger loses his marbles wins!
</li>

<li><strong>Target Audience:</strong>
The target audience for this game would be boys ages 5-12 who think that farts are really funny and would enjoy making the different sounding farts.
</li>

<li><strong>Play Time:</strong>
A single game lasts on average about 1 minute, but if the players only make small, short farts the game could go on for almost forever.
